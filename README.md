=================

DECO3800 Galactic Supremacy Group Development

All our stuff is under the assets at the moment
otherAssets foler is where all the graphical stuff goes
view is where the classes for all the things we can see goes, i.e. ships, solar regions, links, menus
controller is where all the backend stuff goes, i.e. determining battle outcomes, maybe talking to the server...

This is all one (empty) unity project right now that we can add bits to here and there.  You should be able to download (called cloning in github) and import it into Unity
